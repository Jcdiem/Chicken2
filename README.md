# Chicken 2: Eccentric Boogaloo #  
Chicken 2 is a game I made for AP CSP a long time back (I think I'm outside of the no sharing code restriction now) and I'm uploading so I can do some minor fixes and share it off of code.org The game relies on RNG for most events, so if that's not your thing but you want to look at the mechanics, use the account debug debug. Chicken 2 is based off of point and click Flash adventure games very loosely. Due to it being for AP CSP I made sure to keep my humor pretty PC and I think it actually turned ok, even if the references are a bit dated.
  
The game is in a very sorry state right now. Despite that, it does function, if only barely. The only thing you're missing from Chicken 1 is that there is no Chicken. 

For those that want to play: The goal of the game is to get to Lythia, which is a discoverable locaiton.
# How to use #  
Go to the project website.  

When logging into the game, just make a quick sample account with 123 123 or something. If you want to cheat at the game use the login debug debug. Somewhere there's a database file with more dev accounts, if you're into that.
